# <cf>Team Create</c>

Are you sometimes <cr>tired</c> of the <ca>inefficient method of collaboration,</c> where you simply spam upload <cb>copyables</c> and <cl>continuously edit sections back and forth?</c>

Well, I've got the <cj>solution</c> for you! Uhh... <ca>*Team Create!*</c> A mod that allows for <cy>collaboration with other players!</c> Simply <cr>invite your creator friends</c> to a level, set their <cp>permissions,</c> and have a great time editing together!

# <co>Notes:</c>

- <cr>**If you are looking for a much more stable collaboration experience, consider buying the mod [Editor Collab](mod:alk.editor-collab) by alk. While I cannot state any pros and cons between Editor Collab and my mod since I don't have Editor Collab, definitely do compare this mod and Editor Collab to see any (probably noticeable) differences between the two.**</c>

- <cy>**This mod is in ALPHA! Stuff will be broken at anytime. Please consider reporting bugs or any suggestions you may have using the [Mod Comments](mod:user95401.geode-mod-comments) mod.**</c>

# <cl>Question and Answer</c>

## <cj>How do I know if a collaborator joined my Team Create session?</c>

A <cp>system message</c> will <ca>appear,</c> as well as a <cf>user circle that indicates their presence.</c> They can <cy>move their camera,</c> <co>select and edit objects (which does come with an indicator!),</c> <cy>etc.</c>

## <cj>What can I do with the collaborators I invite?</c>

You and the collaborators can **<cf>place</c> <cl>blocks,</c> <cb>triggers,</c> <cp>change settings of the level,</c> and <ca>much more with your creators!</c>**

Based on the <cb>permissions</c> <cl>you gave them,</c> they're <cr>limited</c> as to <cf>what they can do.</c> For example, you <ca>cannot save changes to a level</c> if you are a <cp>"Minimal Collaborator".</c>

<cf>As well as all that good stuff,</c> there's a <cy>chat system</c> you can use to <cp>communicate</c> with <co>creators!</c> <cb>Optionally,</c> there's <cf>Discord</c> or <cj>other communication platforms,</c> but this <cr>serves as a half-decent alternative to them.</c>
